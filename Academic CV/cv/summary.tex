I am an Evolutionary Biologist passionate about uncovering the mechanistic processes behind the diversity of life on Earth. By integrating empirical and computational approaches, I aim to achieve a holistic understanding of evolutionary dynamics. My interests center on interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes and their roles in cellular function, especially in the context of mitochondrial diseases in humans. I also explore evolutionary processes shaping genetic conflicts, such as mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibilities, and the evolution of sex-specific traits. My expertise spans experimental evolution, genomics, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics. I have developed statistical methods to analyze protein-protein interaction stability and applied bioinformatics tools to dissect complex biological data. Currently, I integrate large, multimodal datasets—such as genomics and single-cell analyses—to reveal underlying biological patterns and their evolutionary significance. I am dedicated to translating these insights into a deeper understanding of human health and evolution.
