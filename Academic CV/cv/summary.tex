I am an Evolutionary Biologist passionate about understanding the mechanistic processes behind the diversity of life on Earth. My research integrates empirical and computational approaches to gain a holistic understanding of evolutionary processes. My research interests focus on the interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, and how these contribute to cellular functions, particularly in the context of mitochondrial diseases in humans. In addition, I also investigate the evolutionary processes shaping genetic conflicts such as mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibilities and the evolution of sex-specific traits. My expertise includes experimental evolution, genomics, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics. I have developed statistical methods to analyze protein-protein interaction stability and used bioinformatics tools for the analysis of complex biological data. My current work involves integrating large datasets from different modalities, such as genomics and single-cell analyses, to uncover underlying biological patterns and their evolutionary significance.
