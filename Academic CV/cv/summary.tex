\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
%---------------------------------------------------------
I am a computational biologist with a strong interest in the molecular mechanisms underlying human disease, particularly disorders of the nervous system. My current work at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit focuses on understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases driven by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. I leverage expertise in bioinformatics, single-cell genomics, and statistical modeling to build computational frameworks that dissect the fundamental processes governing the inheritance and effects of mtDNA mutations in neural tissues.

Building on a PhD in mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution, my research bridges evolutionary biology with clinically relevant questions. I use large-scale, multimodal datasets to investigate how mitochondrial dysfunction affects gene regulation, metabolism, and cell-type specific processes in the nervous system. Through this work, I aim to uncover mechanisms contributing to mitochondrial and neurodegenerative diseases, and to support the development of computational tools for their study.
